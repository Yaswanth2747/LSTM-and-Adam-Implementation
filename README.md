# LSTM-Based Neural Network for Sequence Prediction

> An end-to-end implementation of an LSTM network for sentiment analysis and a custom-coded Adam optimizer – with an illustrative breakdown of the update steps.

This repository contains our final course project submission for **CS419M – Machine Learning for CS**, offered in **Autumn 2024** at the **Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Bombay**, under the guidance of **Prof. Abir De**.

## Project Overview

This project explores the use of **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks in sequence modeling and optimization.

- `main_01`: Implementation of an **LSTM-based sentiment classifier** trained on the **IMDB movie reviews** dataset.
- `main_02`: A **custom implementation of the Adam optimizer** coded from scratch and tested for correctness.
